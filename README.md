# Java Priority Queue Examples

This repository contains examples demonstrating the usage of various priority queue implementations in Java.

## Owner

This repository is owned by AADARSH PATIL.

## Overview

Priority queues are data structures that allow elements to be inserted with an associated priority and retrieved according to their priority. This repository includes examples showcasing the usage of different priority queue implementations available in Java, such as `PriorityQueue`, `PriorityBlockingQueue`, `BlockingQueue`, `AbstractQueue`, etc.

## Examples

- `BlockingQueueExample`: Demonstrates the usage of `PriorityBlockingQueue`, a concurrent implementation of the `BlockingQueue` interface.
- `AbstractQueueExample`: Illustrates the usage of `PriorityQueue`, an implementation of the `AbstractQueue` interface.
- `PriorityQueueExample`: Shows how to use the `PriorityQueue` class to implement a priority queue.
- `PriorityBlockingQueueExample`: Provides an example of using `PriorityBlockingQueue`, a concurrent implementation of the `BlockingQueue` interface with priorities.
- Other examples include `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, `ArrayBlockingQueue`, `DelayQueue`, `LinkedBlockingQueue`, and `LinkedTransferQueue`.

## Usage

Each example includes a `runExample()` method demonstrating how to use the respective priority queue implementation. Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements.
